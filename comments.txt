  php artisan make:auth

  php artisan make:migration create_admins_table --create=admins
  php artisan migrate

  --if we register normally and open http://multiauth.app/admin we will get the user interface
  although we registered as a normal user
  that's because in AdminController.php we have lines 14-17 and if u don't specify a guard , the auth middleware is going to default to whatever ur default is,
  in our case the default is just 'web' which has the 'users' provider //see auth.php

  now, if i try http://multiauth.app/admin it redirects to http://multiauth.app/home because we are users

  php artisan make:controller Auth/AdminLoginController

  php artisan tinker //++++++ on ssh ++++++//

  $admin = new App\Admin
  $admin->name = 'moaz'
  $admin->email = 'moaz@gmail.com'
  $admin->password = Hash::make('moazPassword')
  $admin->job_title = 'front-end dev'
  $admin->save()

  Problem 1:
    -if we requested http://multiauth.app/admin when we are logged out, we get user login page not admin login page
  Problem 2:
    -if we are logged in as admins and we go to a page which is protected by the admin guest middleware like http://multiauth.app/admin/login
    the guest middleware says u can't do this u already logged in as admin so it redirects us to  http://multiauth.app/admin
    and because we aren't logged in as users it ends up sending us to the normal login page http://multiauth.app/login

  php artisan make:notification AdminResetPasswordNotification
  //creates a new folder app/Notifications

-----------
Email settings
--------
in vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Auth/Notifications/ResetPassword.php, it should be changed into
  action('Reset Password',route('password.reset', $this->token))

vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Mail/resources/views/html/message.blade.php
//msg content

------------
application name:
  /resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php //didn't change it
  /vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Auth/Console/stubs/make/views/layouts/app.stub //neither did this one

we can change Config::set('app.name', 'New Name in files');


we change APP_NAME=Anas to change the name of the application
also APP_URL=http://localhost should be changed i guess!
