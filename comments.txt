  php artisan make:auth

  php artisan make:migration create_admins_table --create=admins
  php artisan migrate

  --if we register normally and open http://multiauth.app/admin we will get the admin interface
  although we registered as a normal user
  that's because in AdminController.php we have lines 14-17 and if u don't specify a guard , the auth middleware is going to default to whatever ur default is,
  in our case the default is just 'web' which has the 'users' provider //see auth.php

  now, if i try http://multiauth.app/admin it redirects to http://multiauth.app/home because we are users
